A big shout out to [Professor Rob Knell](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbbs/staff/robknell.html) at Queen Mary, University of London, and [Dr. Dylan Childs](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/biosciences/people/academic-staff/dylan-childs) and [Professor Andrew Beckerman](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/biosciences/people/academic-staff/andrew-beckerman) at The University of Sheffield, who taught me how to use `R` and provided much of the inspiration for this course. They have excellent books available online which provide a more detailed introduction to using `R` and `R studio` as well as covering more advanced topics and statistical analysis.
